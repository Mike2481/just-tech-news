{{!-- Your file/folder structure MUST be set up this way for Handlebars.js to work correctly. 
You will always have a main layout located at (and named) views/layouts/main.handlebars. 
All other template files will go directly in the views folder (views/welcome.handlebars). --}}


{{!-- info in double parens gets the value from controllers/home_routes.js --}}
<ol class="post-list">
    {{#each posts as |post|}}
  <li>
    <article class="post">
      <div class="title">
        <a href="{{post.post_url}}" target="_blank">{{post.title}}</a>
        <span>({{post.post_url}})</span>

      <div class="meta">

        <a href="/post/{{post.id}}">{{post.comments.length}} comment(s)</a>
      </div>
    </article>
  </li>
  {{/each}}
  {{!-- Note the use of {{#each}} to begin the loop and {{/each}} to define where it ends. 
  Any HTML code in between (e.g., the <li> element) will be repeated for every item in posts. --}}
</ol>
{{!-- Did you notice the {{ }} expressions that can be used for content (e.g., {{vote_count}} point(s)), 
as well as for attributes in HTML elements (e.g., <a href="{{post_url}}">)? When the template is rendered 
and sent to the client, the expressions will be replaced by the correct data. --}}
